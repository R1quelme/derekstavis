Hey 👋

I'm a technology enthusiast living in Vancouver, British Columbia, 🇨🇦. I currently work as a Software Engineering Manager at @brexhq and am responsible for the Dashboard🖥 and Mobile📱 platforms. I spend my free time 🔧 building software and hardware pet projects, 🛹 e-skateboarding around and 🥁 playing the drums.

## Things I deeply care about
